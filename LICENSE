## 3. Strong Copyleft & Network Source Availability

3.1 **Copyleft.** Any Distribution of the Software or a Modified Work, and any Public Use of a Hosted Service built from the Software or a Modified Work, must be under this same License, in full, at no charge to recipients and users.

3.2 **Complete Corresponding Source.** If You Distribute Object Code or provide a Hosted Service based on the Software or a Modified Work, You must make the Complete Corresponding Source Code of the version actually running or Distributed available to all recipients and all users of the Hosted Service:

(i) via a prominently visible network link from the service or accompanying documentation; and
(ii) under this License, with build and installation instructions sufficient for a competent developer to reproduce the running instance, excluding only **System Libraries**.

3.3 **No Additional Restrictions.** You may not impose further restrictions or contractual terms on recipients or users that conflict with this License, except those strictly necessary to comply with law or to protect credentials and secrets.

3.4 **Installation Information.** If You Distribute the Software or a Modified Work in or for use with a User Product (consumer or enterprise device), You must provide whatever keys, scripts, or instructions are reasonably required to install and run user‑modified versions on that device, unless doing so would violate other laws.

3.5 **Combined Works.** If You combine or link the Software with other code such that a work is formed that includes any portion of the Software (other than through mere inter‑process communication over standard protocols), the resulting work is a **Modified Work** and must be licensed as a whole under this License. The **System Libraries** exception applies.

## 4. Service Offering Restriction (Anti‑SaaS Clause)

4.1 **No Competing Hosted Service.** Except as provided in 4.2, You may **not** provide, operate, or offer the Software or any Modified Work as a Hosted Service to third parties (whether free, freemium, or paid), including operating any multi‑tenant or managed SHGS service that is accessible by the public or by customers outside Your organization.

4.2 **Self‑Hosting Permitted.** You may host the Software or a Modified Work **solely** for Your own organization’s internal use or for a community/guild that You directly administer, provided that: (a) You do not market, brand, or charge for such hosting as a service; (b) all end users belong to and interact within that specific organization/guild; and (c) You comply with Sections 3, 5, and 6.

4.3 **Reserved Right.** The exclusive right to provide a public or commercial Hosted Service for the Software is reserved to the Licensor and its expressly authorized partners.

5.2 **Vixeon ToS Compliance.** You must not use the Software in any way that violates the Vixeon ToS. Where a conflict exists between this License and the Vixeon ToS, this License governs licensing of the Software, but Your **use** remains subject to the Vixeon ToS.

---

## 6. Attribution & Notices

---

## 7. Names, Branding, and Trademarks

---

## 8. Patent License; Defensive Termination

8.1 **Grant.** Each Contributor grants You a perpetual, worldwide, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free patent license to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Software, solely to the extent their Contribution necessarily infringes their patent claims.

---

## 9. Contributor Terms (Inbound = Outbound; Relicensing Right)

9.1 **Inbound = Outbound.** Unless otherwise agreed in writing, Contributions are licensed to the Licensor and to all users under the same terms as this License.

9.2 **Relicensing Permission to Licensor.** Each Contributor irrevocably grants the Licensor a perpetual, worldwide, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free right to relicense that Contributor’s Contributions, in whole or in part, under different terms (including proprietary terms) at the Licensor’s sole discretion, without additional consideration. This clause does not grant any other party such rights.

9.3 **Representations.** By submitting a Contribution, the Contributor represents that they have the legal right to do so and that the Contribution is their original work (or they have sufficient rights to submit it), and it does not knowingly violate third‑party rights.

9.4 **CLA.** The Licensor may require execution of a Contributor License Agreement. In case of conflict, the CLA controls for the Contribution it covers.

---

## 10. Scope, Boundaries, and Compatibility

10.1 **External Communication.** A work that communicates with the Software solely through network protocols or command‑line interfaces, without including or linking to any portion of the Software, is not by itself a Modified Work.

10.2 **Plug‑ins and Modules.** If a plug‑in, module, or extension uses any internal, non‑stable, or private interfaces of the Software, or links to it (statically or dynamically), it forms a Modified Work and must be licensed under this License.

10.3 **System Libraries Exception.** The obligations of Section 3 do not apply to unmodified System Libraries.

10.4 **Third‑Party Components.** Third‑party components included with the Software remain governed by their own licenses. In case of conflict, those licenses control for those components.

---

## 11. Privacy & Security

11.1 **Credentials and Secrets.** Nothing in this License requires disclosure of private credentials, signing keys, or secrets beyond what is strictly necessary to build and run the Software.

11.2 **Telemetry.** If You add telemetry, analytics, or tracking, You must disclose this prominently and provide users with a reasonable opt‑out where practicable.

---

## 12. Compliance, Termination, and Cure

12.1 **Automatic Termination.** This License terminates automatically for You upon any material breach (including Sections 3–7), without prejudice to any other rights.

12.2 **Cure Period.** If You cease all violation within **30 days** of notice from the Licensor or any Contributor, Your license is provisionally reinstated unless and until the Licensor provides final notice of termination. Permanent termination occurs if You violate again after reinstatement or if the violation is not cured within 30 days.

12.3 **Post‑Termination.** Upon termination, You must stop all use, Distribution, and hosting of the Software and Modified Works, and destroy or return all copies under Your control, except for archival copies retained solely for legal compliance.

12.4 **Injunctive Relief.** The Licensor may seek injunctive or equitable relief for breaches that threaten irreparable harm (including violations of Sections 4, 5, 6, or 7).

THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE LICENSOR AND CONTRIBUTORS FOR DIRECT DAMAGES SHALL NOT EXCEED **US\$0**.
